These soft, pillowy treasures are a staple in many households, cherished for their versatility and comforting texture. Here's an easy recipe to bring this traditional delight to your kitchen.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 kg potatoes (preferably starchy)</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>100g all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>A pinch of nutmeg</li>
                <li>Salt to taste</li>
                <li>Bread crumbs</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Method:</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li><b>Prepare the Potatoes:</b> Start by boiling the potatoes until they are tender. Drain and let them cool slightly. Then, peel and mash them until smooth.</li>
                <li><b>Mix the Ingredients: </b>In a large bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, eggs, flour, a pinch of nutmeg, and salt. Mix well to form a smooth dough. If it's too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
                <li><b>Form the Dumplings: </b>With floured hands, shape the dough into balls. For an added twist, insert a small cube of bread into the center of each dumpling.</li>
                <li><b>Cook the Dumplings: </b>Bring a large pot of salted water to a simmer. Gently drop the dumplings into the water. They are done when they float to the surface - usually in about 10-15 minutes.</li>
                <li><b>Serve Hot:</b>Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and drain any excess water. Serve hot, accompanied by your favorite gravy or sauce.</li>
            </ol>
